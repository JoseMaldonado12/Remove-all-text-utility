# Remove-all-text-utility
A simple C program that removes all text from a file; but doesnt delete it. Perfect for testing purposes- got a file you wanna re-use
but can't be bothered to delete the text everytime? Well this simple program does the job for you! I reccomend adding it to a script for maximum 
optimization. 

If you do plan on using it, let me know, would love to hear any ongoing projects this may be a part of!
