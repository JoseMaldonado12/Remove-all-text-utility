# Remove-all-text-utility
A simple C program that removes all text from a file; but doesnt delete it. Perfect for testing purposes- got a file you wanna re-use
but can't be bothered to delete the text everytime? Well this simple program does the job for you! I reccomend adding it to a script for maximum 
optimization. 

How to use: In the command line simply run this program as "programname filetocuttext" and it will cut the text of your chosen file.
This program does not create new files if the filename is wrong; this can be easily changed by fiddling around with the code, which
is highly encouraged!

Anyone can download and fix/modify this code as they see fit without the need to cite me (unless its for a school project!). However,
I would love to hear any ongoing projects this may be a part of!
